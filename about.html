  <h1 class = "title" >Discover Ottawa's architecture and street art</h1>


  <p class = "paragraph" >Our idea is simple: to show people how much Canada's Capital really has to offer.
    Here, you can browse through all the buildings and art pieces that we have displayed,
    to find out where they are located and maybe visit them for yourself! </p>


  <h1 class = "title" >Why do this?</h1>
  <p class = "paragraph" >One of my favourite cities is New York City. One of the reasons I love it so much is
    because you are always surrounded by SO much art. Art expressed through buildings and
    art expressed through murals and spray paintings on practically every street corner.
    On my latest trip there, I realized how little of that I noticed in my own home town
    and how it is probably being underappreciated by so many like me. I am also a computer
    science student. So i am always looking for ways to practice and learn new skills relating
    to the field. As a result, my father gave me a great idea. To creating a website where
    I can showcase Ottawa's art and combine my passion of photography and computer science.
    So, here we are! </p>

  <h1 class = "title" >Can I contribute?</h1>
  <p class = "paragraph" >Yes please! If you know of an art piece or a particularily interesting building that isnt
    displayed on this website, please <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me. </p>
